KANOO-4609,[BE] - Multiple Merchant Money Flow,"Currently, when a user receives a Gift Cash Card that can be used at multiple merchants from GDS, the issuer’s Cash Card balance isn't deducted. The user can use it at the issued merchant or another accepted merchant. If he uses it at the issued merchant, the payment flow doesn't change. If he uses it at another accepted merchant, that merchant has to pay the fee related to the function and paid amount. This doesn't make sense so that we need to define the flow.The solution is after a user uses a Gift cash Card at an accepted merchant ( except the issued merchant) successfully. Kanoo Reserve Account will fund the paid amount for the accepted merchant immediately. The accepted merchant only pays the fee related to the function. Below is the money flow when a user uses a Gift Cash Card from GDS at multiple linked merchants.*Step 1:* a GDS manager creates, marks issuer merchant then sends Gift Cash Card to users successfully. The issuer merchant pays nothing for Kanoo*Step 2:* The user uses the Gift Cash Card at a linked merchant and issuer successfully.The linked merchant pays the fee *“Kanoo Cash Card - Processing Fee”* for Kanoo based on the paid amount and function. *Save transaction as the current flow on ARM, Visipay.*We don’t need to transfer money from Kanoo Reserve Cash Card to linked merchant.",5

KANOO-4047,Gift Card Distribution - Multiple Merchant Money Flow,"Currently, when a user receives a GC that can be redeemed at multiple merchants from DOSS, he can redeem it at the issued merchant or another redeemable merchant. If he redeems at the issued merchant, the redemption flow doesn't change. If he redeems at another redeemable merchant, that merchant has to pay the Redemption fee and Redeemed amount. This doesn't make sense so that we need to define the flow.The solution is after a user redeeming a GC at a redeemable merchant ( except the issued merchant) successfully. Kanoo Reserve Account will fund the redeemed amount for the redeemable merchant immediately.  The redeemable merchant only pays the Redemption fee. Kanoo Reserve Account will withdraw the redeemed amount from the issued merchant later ( not do in this period). Below is the money flow when a user redeems a GC given from DOSS at multiple linked merchants.*Step 1:* a DOSS manager creates, marks issuer merchant then sends Gc to users successfully. The issuer merchant pays nothing for Kanoo*Step 2:* The user redeems the GC at a redeemable merchant ( except the issuer) successfully. Ex: the user redeems $10 GC for $20 order#  The Kanoo Reserve Account ( Cash Card or SD based on the user’s payment method) funds $10 of redeemed GC for the redeemed merchant. Save transaction with type “Fund Gift Card Redemption” for the redeemed amount on ARM ( for redeemed merchant and master) and Visipay (Transaction, Reserve Account, Card details)# The redeemable merchant pays the Redemption fee for Kanoo based on the redeemed amount.

(disable “Select“ text)** If point balance is 0, the point selection will be disabled, user cannot select point. (disable “Select“ text)** If user chooses points first, then chooses coupon / gift card, the subtracted amount will be recalculated based on the priority of rule #1 above. If the final total amount is $0.00 (after choosing gift card / coupon card), rule #2 is applied.** Example:*** The total amount that the user has to pay is $ 20.00, they first choose $15.00 of points, then choose $6.00 of coupon. The value of the coupon will be subtracted as the highest priority (20.00 - 6.00 = $14.00), so the points the user previously selected is reset up to maximum $14.00.*** The total amount the user has to pay is $20.00, they first choose $15.00 of points, then choose $20.00 of coupon. The value of the coupon will be subtracted as the highest priority (20.00 - 20.00 = $ 0.00), so the points previously selected by the user are reset to $0.00, which also means that point selection will be automatically disabled at that time.** Disable the point selection if user point balance is 0 or the final amount that user need to pay is 0+_Point Redemption_+* In Order Summary box, there is a new line item called Point Redemption positioned below Gift Card, including Select link.* There are 2 cases that we should disable the point selection** User’s point balance is 0** If the amount subtracted when the user selects the coupon / gift card is $0.00,* Clicking on Select link display a modal with the following things:** Point Available: this is user's point balance** Point To Use: this is the text-field to enter the number of points*** Allow entering only positive integers (including 0). It automatically adds commas when the number is greater than 999. For instance, 1,000 or 1,000,000*** Default value is 0. *** Maximum points allowed: this is the maximum number of points that I can select. This based on the total amount that I have to pay**** For example, I assume $1.00 = 100 points, if PB (Point balance) is 1,000 points, YP (You Pay) is $5.00 so that MPA (Maximum points allowed) is 500 points**** Next example, if PB is 1,000 points, YP is $20.00 so that MPA is 1,000 points**** Last, if PB is 1,000 points, YP is $10.00 so that MPA is 1,000 points*** Point to Dollar: while I'm entering Point To Use amount, this always converts that point amount into dollar amount**** The point exchange rate: this always $1.00 = 100 Points*** When Point To Use is empty or 0, clicking on Apply button will display as when I do not use points*** When I’m gonna enter a number that is greater than MPA, it automatically changes that number to MPA * When clicking on Apply button, it applies my selection. It displays the number of selected points below Point Redemption text, and Point Available.* I can use Point Redemption function when using Cash Card, Sand Dollar Card, Kanoo Gift Cash Card * In case of guest payments, hide Point Redemption function+_After payment_+After making payment successfully with points use:* User's point balance is updated by reducing the points used for the order.* If merchant does not have enough points to give users, don’t reward points for user* Points tab of Wallet - Point Redemption section: there is a new transaction. For example, Buy Product   -1,000* Transaction: ** A transaction is written in Visipay, ARM, User site** Transaction Type: Point Redemption. It displays the dollar amount being equivalent to the number of used points. *** For instance, If I make a payment with 200 points used ($2.00), then YOU PAY remains $3.00 (I used Kanoo Kash Card to pay this remainder). If making payment successfully, I see 2 transactions**** One is Kanoo Card Purchase with amount $3.00**** One is Point Redemption with amount $2.00*** If I make a payment that I COMPLETELY use points to payment. It records only one transaction. For instance, YOU PAY is $3.00 initially, I use 300 points (My point balance is 500) to make payment so that it records one transaction, Point Redemption with amount $3.00** Some example*** When buying product in Marketplace, if I use both points and money, for example, YOU PAY is $10.00, I used 500 Points and $5.00 Cash Card. It logs 2 transactions**** Point Redemption***** Amount B$5.00***** Beneficiary: business name of merchant***** Remitter: user full name**** Kanoo Card Purchase*** When buying product in Marketplace, if I use both points completely, for example, YOU PAY is $10.00, I used 1,000 Points. It logs 1 transaction**** Point Redemption***** Amount B$10.00***** Beneficiary: business name of merchant***** Remitter: user full name*** When buying product in Reward Option, if I buy a gift card or product whose price is 500 Points. It logs 1 transaction**** Point Redemption***** Amount B$5.00***** Beneficiary: business name of merchant***** Remitter: user full name* We also need to handle API for “Scan to Pay“ screens.
